# Guys in Pants

Two funny guys who rarely wear pants.

This site is based on the [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) website, so _huge_ props to those devs for doing all the heavy lifting and making this an easy transition for us!

## Requirements

- Node 18.1.2 or higher

## Development

Install the correct version of Node with `nvm install`.

Then install all dependencies with `pnpm install`.

And the site can be spun up locally by running `pnpm run dev` and visiting `http://localhost:6969`.

Then you do some work.

When you are ready for prime time, submit a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted.

If you want to build your own version, just run `npm run build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `vercel`.
